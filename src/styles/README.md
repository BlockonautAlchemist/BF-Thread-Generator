  className="input-modern focus-ring-animation" 
  type="text" 
  placeholder="Enter text..."
/>
```

## Accessibility

All animations and effects include proper accessibility considerations:

- Reduced motion preferences are respected
- Focus states are clearly visible
- Animations have appropriate timing
- Color contrasts meet WCAG guidelines

To ensure accessibility, always test your UI with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Performance Considerations

- Use `will-change` and `transform` properties for smoother animations
- Avoid animating layout properties (use `transform` and `opacity` instead)
- Use `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` for users who prefer reduced motion
- Consider using `requestAnimationFrame` for JavaScript animations
